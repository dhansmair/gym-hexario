SDL2_gfx extends SDL2 with methods to draw more complex
geometric shapes like polygons. SDL2 itself only contains 
methods to draw circles, rectangles etc.

These are only the files I require from SDL2_gfx,
the original sources can be found at 
http://www.ferzkopp.net/wordpress/2016/01/02/sdl_gfx-sdl2_gfx/

SDL2_gfxPrimitives.c is slightly changed so I do not 
need to also include SDL2_rotozoom.c / .h
